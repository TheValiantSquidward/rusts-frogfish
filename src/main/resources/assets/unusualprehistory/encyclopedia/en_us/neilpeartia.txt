A strange species of Eocene frogfish, very little is known about the strange and majestic creature known as Neilpeartia Ceratoi.
<NEWLINE>
Neilpeartia is quite the handy fishing buddy to keep around. Left to its own devices, it can collect piles and piles of rare and even some usually non-renewable loot. Of course, you can always decide to kill the poor thing instead. When slain, it drops Raw Nellpeartia, a poisonous food item that can be brewed into a potion of glowing, or crafted into Fish Leather. It may alternatively drop a Shed Lure, which alongside some Fish Leather, can be crafted into a new music disc, Lure, or your very own Lure Adorned Cap. If you want a 100% chance at obtaining a lure, simply drop your frogfish into a dunkleosteusâ€™ tank and let the dunk do his work.
