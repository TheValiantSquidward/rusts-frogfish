The prehistoric anhinga, giganhinga, known scientifically as Giganhinga kiyuensis, is a semi-aquatic flightless bird, an overweight relative of today’s anhinga.

Giganhinga loves to sit on player’s heads. Simply right click it to place one on your head, similarly to talapanas. Unlike talapanas, they are quite useful to the player, allowing you to fire entire fish as deadly projectiles from their mouths (as long as you have an inventory stocked with raw blochius). Giganhinga will also lay eggs of varying quality over time. These eggs range from being infertile to being made of solid gold. When thrown, these rare golden eggs break into EXP orbs. Giganhinga can also be slain and cooked for their delicious meat and supply of feathers.
