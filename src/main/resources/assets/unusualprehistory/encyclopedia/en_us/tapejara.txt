King of the Skies, Lord of the Ways, a Brazilian Pterosaur from the Cretaceous Period, tapejara wellnhoferi. Tapejara, which comes in three different variants, is a graceful glutton of a pterosaur, as greedy as it is breathtaking.

Tapejara, as the eternally hungry glutton it is, will feed upon just about any fruit you can think of. Overfeed it a little, then right click it to have it regurgitate certain items. Glow berries give you glowstone, glistering melons give you seedy remains, and feeding it Ensete Oregonese Fruit causes it to shed its specific crest depending on the variant. The crests can be crafted into the three legendary instruments of incredible power. I could have sworn there was another interaction as wellâ€¦ something much stranger and less orthodox.
