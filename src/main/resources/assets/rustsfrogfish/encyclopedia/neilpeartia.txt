A strange species of Eocene frogfish, very little is known about the strange creature known as Neilpeartia Ceratoi. So little in fact, that our top scientists needed to fill in the missing DNA gaps with Beelzebufo DNA in order to revive a complete creature. This resulted in some… odd… deformities.

Neilpeartia is quite the handy fishing buddy to keep around. Left to its own devices, it can collect piles and piles of rare and even some usually non-renewable loot. Of course, you can always decide to kill the poor thing instead. When slain, it drops Raw Nellpeartia, a poisonous food item that can be brewed into a potion of glowing, or crafted into Fish Leather. It may alternatively drop a Shed Lure, which alongside some Fish Leather, can be crafted into a new music disc, Lure, or your very own Lure Adorned Cap. If you want a 100% chance at obtaining a lure, simply drop your frogfish into a dunkleosteus’ tank and let the dunk do his work.
